# GPX Track Cleaner

A Python script for cleaning GPX tracks. It removes consecutive duplicate track points (based on latitude, longitude, and elevation) and allows retaining only every nth track point. Especially useful for processing GPS data from FPV drones with Betaflight.

## Purpose
This script efficiently reduces and cleans GPX data for better analysis and visualization in software like GeoTracker, OsmAnd, or Google Earth Pro.

### Use Cases
- Post-flight analysis and visualization of FPV drone flights.
- Improving data quality from Betaflight logs by removing redundant entries.
- Preventing issues with flight visualization (e.g., incorrect speed calculations, display errors on maps).

## Generating GPX Files from Betaflight

If you are using an FPV drone with Betaflight and GPS logging enabled, you can generate GPX files using the following steps:

1. **Enable GPS Logging** in Betaflight: Ensure that Blackbox logging is activated and GPS data is being recorded.
2. **Carry outÂ your drone flight**.
3. **Download Blackbox Logs**: Retrieve the `.bbl` log files from your flight controller.
4. **Convert to GPX**:
   - Open the logs in **Betaflight Blackbox Explorer**.
   - Use the **Export to GPX** function to generate the GPX files.

These GPX files can now be processed with this script to remove redundant data and optimize them for further analysis.

## Installation & Requirements
### Requirements
- **Python** must be installed.
- The script **gpx-cleaner.py** must be downloaded.

## Usage
### Configuration
Before running, you can adjust the `keep_every_nth_trkpt` variable in the main function:
- `1`: Keeps all remaining track points (no additional filtering).
- `5`: Retains approximately one track point per second (at 200 Hz logging). This can help smooth out inaccuracies in speed calculation, reducing potential noise artifacts.

### Running the Script
Use the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python3 gpx-cleaner.py <path-to-directory-with-gpx-files>
```
Replace `<path-to-directory-with-gpx-files>` with the directory containing your GPX files.

### Output
- Cleaned GPX files are saved in a subfolder `/output` within the specified directory.
- Duplicate entries are removed, and depending on the setting, only every nth track point is retained.

## Example
If your GPX files are in `/home/user/gpx_data`, run:
```sh
python3 gpx-cleaner.py /home/user/gpx_data
```
The cleaned files will be stored in `/home/user/gpx_data/output/`.
